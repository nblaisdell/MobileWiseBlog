        lorum ipsum on a plane, don't really have a lorum thing so I'll just type some stuff here I guess this one will be a longer one and then the next post will be shorter because some of his posts will be short and stuff but this one has to be long so I'll keep typing for a bit and then see where I am. Well this is a mighty fine day don't you think. I think so. That's why I said it. I'm on a plane.

        blog, random and short stuff - add a bit of lorum to just make it wrap a bit or not whatever. Actually I'll make this one a little bit longer cause hey why not you know? And wrap.
